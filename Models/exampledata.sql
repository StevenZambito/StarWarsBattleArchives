The Geonosians built the Trade Federation’s droid army and played a key role in arming the Separatists. As the Separatist Crisis escalated, Count Dooku met the leaders of the Separatist conspiracy on Geonosis. Obi-Wan Kenobi spied on this meeting and reported back to Coruscant, but was captured – as were his would-be rescuers, Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala. A rescue mission led by Jedi and clones became the first battle of the Clone Wars. With the Republic’s new army pressing its attack, Dooku retreated with plans for a secret weapon of Geonosian design – the planet-killing Death Star battle station. - StarWars.com', 1, 'https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_geonosis_01_169_1d04e086.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1560%2C878&width=960');

It was orchestrated by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine of the Republic, who was secretly Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Sidious arranged for himself to be kidnapped as Palpatine by the Separatist cyborg General Grievous as part of a plot to bring Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker closer to the dark side of the Force. Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, arrived on scene with the Open Circle Fleet. The two flew into the heart of the massive battle, determined to rescue Palpatine from Separatist custody. They succeeded in boarding the flagship of General Grievous and after a lengthy duel, Skywalker killed the Confederacy leader, Head of State Count Dooku, at the command of Palpatine. - Wookipedia', 1, 'https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp7733833.png');

The triumph of the Alliance over the Empire, and the void left in the wake of the demise of the Emperor, gave the Alliance the opportunity to give rise to the New Republic, which ultimately prevailed over the Empire in the Battle of Jakku one year later. The legacy of the Battle of Endor reverberated for decades after the fighting ended, including into the brewing war between the Imperial-inspired First Order and the Resistance that arose to combat it. - Wookipedia', 1, 'https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_endor_01_169_68ba9bdc.jpeg?region=0%2C49%2C1560%2C780');

They established Echo Base and began enlarging ice caverns and adapting their transports to the extreme cold of Hoth. To guard against discovery by Imperial probe droids, Rebel scouts patrolled the area around Echo Base on tauntauns, native bipedal lizards that could withstand the planet’s frigid conditions. During one such recon mission, Commander Luke Skywalker was viciously attacked by a prowling wampa. He survived the encounter thanks to the Force and Han Solo, but only barely. Echo Base’s Rebels faced other perils as well. A probe droid discovered the Rebel equipment and sent imagery back to the Empire before it was destroyed. General Rieekan ordered an immediate evacuation, but the Empire arrived in force before the Rebels could escape. At the Battle of Hoth, massive AT-AT walkers engaged the Alliance’s snowspeeders and ground troops. Though key Rebel leaders managed to escape capture, the battle was a costly defeat for the Alliance. - StarWars.com', 1, 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xHRHrhMm4WPfQ5OzTXE1kXz0BjI=/0x0:815x543/1200x800/filters:focal(0x0:815x543)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3715177/atat.jpg');
